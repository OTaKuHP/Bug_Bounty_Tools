This is my poor mans version of Burp Collaborator :)

Usage: runSSRFchecks.sh /tmp/SomelistOfURLs.txt /tmp/FileToOutputResultsto.txt

The input file should be full URLs like this:

https://somewebsite.com
http://someotherwebsite.com

This is still sort of a work in progress so let me know if you have suggestions or issues.
